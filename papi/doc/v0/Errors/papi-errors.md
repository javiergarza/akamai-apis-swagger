This section shows you how to handle various kinds of error responses
the Property Manager API generates. In addition to standard HTTP
error responses, it discusses how to resolve errors reported in rule
trees before you activate a property, and how to deal with errors from
variables as they're interpreted on the edge once you activate a
property. This section also lists the range of HTTP response codes,
provides details for many API-specific error messages along with their
likely causes, and reports any known issues remaining in the current
API release.
