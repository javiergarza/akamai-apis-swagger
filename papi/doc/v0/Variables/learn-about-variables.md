This section shows how to manage _variables_, custom text values that
interpret throughout a rule tree when the property executes at
runtime. You can embed built-in variables to capture contextual
information about the client's request, or create your own variables
based on a variety of inputs. You can perform conditional logic based
on the variable's value, and catch any unforeseen errors that execute
on the edge at runtime.

Variables allow you to implement dynamic functionality that previously
was only possible by injecting
[`advanced`]({{base.url}}/{{page.language}}/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#advanced)
custom XML metadata, a process requiring assistance from your Akamai
representative. Variables may not completely replace advanced metadata
functionality for all applications, but can greatly reduce the need.
