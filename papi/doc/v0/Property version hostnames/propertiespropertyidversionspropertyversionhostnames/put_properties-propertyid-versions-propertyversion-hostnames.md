excerpt: "Modify the set of hostname entries for a property version. For\neach hostname entry, specify a `cnameFrom` along with either a\n`cnameTo` or `edgeHostnameId`.\nIf you remove a hostname from an active property configuration,\nyou can then reassign it to another property, or use the\n[Edge Hostname API](https://developer.akamai.com/api/core_features/edge_hostnames/v1.html#getcertificatefortheedgehostname)\n(HAPI) to delete the edge hostname.\n\nThere are no POST or DELETE operations to add or remove\nhostnames from a property, so to assign them you need to\nmake a PUT request that specifies the entire set as an\narray. Since the data sent in the PUT request is an array,\nadding an `If-Match` HTTP header is the only way to prevent\noverwriting edits from another client. See [Concurrency\ncontrol](doc:concurrency-control) for more information on this\ntechnique.\n\nIf you activate a property version that specifies a hostname\nalready active on another property, it's removed from that\nproperty, and a new property version is automatically\ncreated and activated with the change. Otherwise you don't\nreceive any warning when saving a set of overlapping\nhostnames on an inactive version.\n\nSet the `validateHostnames` query parameter to `false` to\nbypass a set of validation tests that may significantly slow\nthis operation's execution time. See [Fast validation,\nactivation, and fallback](doc:fast-validation) for guidance on when to\ndefer validation. See [JSON problems](doc:json-problem-responses) for\ninformation on how validation data is embedded within the\nresponse object."
