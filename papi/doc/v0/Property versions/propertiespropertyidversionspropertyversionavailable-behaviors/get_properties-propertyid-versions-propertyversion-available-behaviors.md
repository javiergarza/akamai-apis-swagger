excerpt: "Lists the set of\n[behaviors](http://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#behaviors)\nyou may apply within a property version's rules. The\navailable set is determined by the product under which you\ncreated the property, and any additional modules enabled\nunder your account.\n\nNote that this list of available behaviors is more accurate\nthan that specified in the [rule format\nschema](#getruleformatschema), which includes behaviors you\nmay potentially add to your contract for a given product,\nbut that aren't currently active. However, it only lists\nbehaviors _currently_ available on your contract, so you\nshould only use it to list available behaviors for the\ncurrent property version. If you had a behavior enabled at\none time, but then dropped it from your contract, a list of\navailable behaviors for an older property version might be\ninaccurate."
