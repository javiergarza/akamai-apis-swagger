excerpt: "Lists the set of\n[criteria](http://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#criteria)\nyou may apply within a property version's rules. The available\nset is determined by the product under which you created the\nproperty, and any additional modules enabled under your\naccount.\n\nNote that this list of available criteria is more accurate\nthan that specified in the [rule format\nschema](#getruleformatschema), which includes criteria you\nmay potentially add to your contract for a given product,\nbut that aren't currently active. However, it only lists\ncriteria _currently_ available on your contract, so you\nshould only use it to list available criteria for the\ncurrent property version. If you had a behavior enabled at\none time, but then dropped it from your contract, a list of\navailable criteria for an older property version might be\ninaccurate."
