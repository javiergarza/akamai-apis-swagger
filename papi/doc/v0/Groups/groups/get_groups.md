slug: "get_groups"
excerpt: "You need information about the prevailing group to access\nmost PAPI interfaces. This operation provides a read-only\nlist of groups, which may contain properties. This operation\nprovides a flat list of groups, along with `parentGroupId`\ninformation to structure them as a hierarchy. Each group\nalso lists any available contracts that enable property\nfeatures, but not which group contains a given property. The\n[Identity Management: User Administration\nAPI](http://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/identity_management_user_admin/v2.html)\nallows you to associate properties with groups, and to\nmodify the group hierarchy.\n\nSIERRA TEST: See [ID prefixes](doc:id-prefixes).
