These errors relate to how specific behaviors execute. They may be listed within [Rule](#rule) objects, and may prevent you from activating the property version.

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `206override` |  The [`responseCode`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#responsecode) behavior's `206override` option allows the 206 response to be overwritten, not recommended because it applies to byte-range responses. Confirm you want to do this, and contact your Akamai representative for guidance. |
| `advanced_on_image_management_off` |  The [`imageManager`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#imagemanager) behavior is configured to use a custom policy, but the behavior is disabled, so it has no effect. |
| `advanced_on_warning` |  When overriding the default policy, if the specified `policyToken` isn't found, [`imageManager`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#imagemanager) applies the default and doesn't save the one you specified. |
| `applicationloadbalancer_needed` |  For an `APPLICATION_LOAD_BALANCER` [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) to work, an [`applicationLoadBalancer`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#applicationloadbalancer) behavior must also be enabled. |
| `aws_verificationmode_validation` |  To set a third-party [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) hostname, set the `verificationMode` to `THIRD_PARTY` or `CUSTOM`. |
| `basic_redirect_conflict` |  You can't specify both the [`redirect`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#redirect) and [`redirectplus`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#redirectplus) behaviors. |
| `beware_of_conditions` |  A behavior that implements a persistent connection may mean that a specified condition no longer works. |
| `cache_key_case_off_ext_case_on` |  With [`cacheKeyIgnoreCase`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachekeyignorecase) enabled, you shouldn't specify a case-sensitive match, otherwise two different requests that vary only by case may get different results, even though they refer to the same cached object. |
| `cache_key_case_off_filename_case_on` |  With [`cacheKeyIgnoreCase`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachekeyignorecase) enabled, you shouldn't specify a case-sensitive match, otherwise two different requests that vary only by case may get different results, even though they refer to the same cached object. |
| `cache_key_case_off_path_case_on` |  With [`cacheKeyIgnoreCase`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachekeyignorecase) enabled, you shouldn't specify a case-sensitive match, otherwise two different requests that vary only by case may get different results, even though they refer to the same cached object. |
| `cachekeyqueryparams` |  Since `NET_STORAGE` [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) servers don't honor query strings, set [`cacheKeyQueryParams`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachekeyqueryparams) to `IGNORE_ALL` to avoid more than cache key for the same object. |
| `caching` |  You're potentially caching content identified as [`personallyIdentifiableInformation`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#personallyidentifiableinformation), so you should set the [`caching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#caching) `behavior` to `NO_STORE` or `BYPASS_CACHE`. |
| `caching_bypass` |  The specified behavior only applies to cacheable content, not when [`caching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#caching) is set to `NO_STORE` or `BYPASS_CACHE`. |
| `caching_enabled` |  The [`sureRoute`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#sureroute) behavior only applies when [`caching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#caching) is set to `NO_STORE`. |
| `caching_maxage` |  For best performance when using a `NET_STORAGE` [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin), set the [`caching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#caching) `ttl` to over 10 minutes. |
| `can_not_mix_delegate_and_custom` |  You can't specify more than one [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) behavior with a `verificationMode` of both `PLATFORM_SETTINGS` and `CUSTOM`. |
| `centralauth` |  A `NET_STORAGE` [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) can't be used along with [`centralAuthorization`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#centralauthorization). |
| `changing_cpcode_warning` |  CP codes specified by [`imageManager`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#imagemanager) affect cached images. If you change the CP codes after deploying the images in a production environment, image caches get refreshed, which may overload your origin. |
| `conflict_dscaching` |  Applying a behavior that modifies `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers may interfere with [`caching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#caching) when both are applied to the same request. |
| `cookie_value_empty_need_to_disable_session_persistence` |  The [`edgeLoadBalancingOrigin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgeloadbalancingorigin) behavior's `enableSessionPersistence` is on, but [`edgeLoadBalancingDataCenter`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgeloadbalancingdatacenter) is missing a `cookieName`. |
| `cookie_value_set_need_to_enable_session_persistence` |  The [`edgeLoadBalancingOrigin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgeloadbalancingorigin) behavior's `enableSessionPersistence` is off, but [`edgeLoadBalancingDataCenter`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgeloadbalancingdatacenter) specifies a `cookieName` that doesn't work. |
| `cpcode_behavior_not_allowed` |  The [`cpCode`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cpcode) behavior can't appear within the same rule as [`imageManager`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#imagemanager), which specifies its own CP code settings. |
| `customer_origin` |  If the [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) server doesn't support etags, the [`largeFileOptimization`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#largefileoptimization) behavior may not work correctly, and data may be corrupted. |
| `disable_gzip` |  When enabling [`edgeSideIncludes`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgesideincludes), don't set [`gzipResponse`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#gzipresponse) to `ALWAYS` work, otherwise content goes through compression and decompression unnecessarily. |
| `dontallow_caching` |  The [`downgradeProtocol`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#downgradeprotocol) behavior isn't allowed when [`caching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#caching) is set to `NO_STORE` or `BYPASS_CACHE`. |
| `dontallow_delete` |  The [`downgradeProtocol`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#downgradeprotocol) behavior isn't allowed along with [`allowDelete`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#allowdelete). |
| `dontallow_modoutgoingreqheader` |  The [`downgradeProtocol`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#downgradeprotocol) behavior isn't allowed along with [`modifyOutgoingRequestHeader`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#modifyoutgoingrequestheader). |
| `dontallow_pii` |  The [`downgradeProtocol`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#downgradeprotocol) behavior isn't allowed for content marked as [`personallyIdentifiableInformation`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#personallyidentifiableinformation). |
| `dontallow_post` |  The [`downgradeProtocol`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#downgradeprotocol) behavior isn't allowed along with [`allowPost`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#allowpost). |
| `dontallow_put` |  The [`downgradeProtocol`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#downgradeprotocol) behavior isn't allowed along with [`allowPut`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#allowput). |
| `downstream_bust` |  The [`shutr`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#shutr) behavior busts downstream caches to prevent non-Akamai proxies from tampering with content. If [`downstreamCache`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#downstreamcache) is set to values other than `BUST`, [`shutr`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#shutr) overrides it. |
| `downstream_caching_indeterminate` |  A specified behavior may expose content identified as [`personallyIdentifiableInformation`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#personallyidentifiableinformation). You should set a [`downstreamCache`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#downstreamcache) to `BUST` the cache, or `ALLOW` it but with `sendPrivate` enabled. |
| `downstream_caching_without_private` |  A specified behavior may expose content identified as [`personallyIdentifiableInformation`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#personallyidentifiableinformation). You should set a [`downstreamCache`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#downstreamcache) to `BUST` the cache, or `ALLOW` it but with `sendPrivate` enabled. |
| `elb_must_use_other_cn` |  When using an `EDGE_LOAD_BALANCING_ORIGIN_GROUP` [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin), you can't specify `{{Origin Hostname}}` in the `customValidCnValues`. |
| `elb_origin_definition_needed` |  To specify an [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) of `EDGE_LOAD_BALANCING_ORIGIN_GROUP`, you also need to enable an [`edgeLoadBalancingOrigin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgeloadbalancingorigin) behavior that defines the origin. |
| `elb_origin_missing` |  An [`edgeLoadBalancingAdvanced`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgeloadbalancingadvanced) behavior requires an accompanying [`edgeLoadBalancingOrigin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgeloadbalancingorigin). |
| `empty_cookie_value_and_failover_rules` |  The [`edgeLoadBalancingDataCenter`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgeloadbalancingdatacenter) is invalid because its cookie value is empty and `enableFailover` is turned off. |
| `extension_match_advised` |  To apply this behavior to large files, you should match the [`fileExtension`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#fileextension) or otherwise avoid applying the behavior to small files, for which it may cause a delay. |
| `filename_match_advised` |  You should enable [`limitBitRate`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#limitbitrate) with a [`filename`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#filename), [`fileExtension`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#fileextension), or [`path`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#path) match. |
| `g2o_modoutgoing_warning` |  You can't use [`modifyOutgoingResponseHeader`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#modifyoutgoingresponseheader) to modify the `X-Akamai-G2O-Auth-Data` and `X-Akamai-G2O-Auth-Sign` headers specified by the [`g2oheader`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#g2oheader) behavior. |
| `http2_requires_secure` |  The [`http2`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#http2) behavior requires that the property [`is_secure`](#thedefaultrule). |
| `includeallqs` |  If one [`cacheId`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cacheid) behavior is set to `INCLUDE_ALL_QUERY_PARAMS`, there can't be another in the same rule that includes or excludes specific parameters. |
| `includeqs` |  If one [`cacheId`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cacheid) behavior is set to include a specific set of query parameters, there can't be another in the same rule that excludes others. |
| `incompatible_opts` |  The [`failAction`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#failaction) behavior isn't compatible when the [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) is set to `EDGE_LOAD_BALANCING_ORIGIN_GROUP`. |
| `incompatible_originbasepath` |  You can't apply the [`rewriteUrl`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#rewriteurl) and [`baseDirectory`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#basedirectory) behaviors to the same request. |
| `incompatible_ppf_siteshield` |  The [`siteShield`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#siteshield) behavior is incompatible with [`predictivePrefetching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#predictiveprefetching). |
| `incompatible_with_any_conditions` |  You can't specify [`allowCloudletsOrigins`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#allowcloudletsorigins) with any matching criteria. |
| `incompatible_with_any_features` |  You can't specify [`allowCloudletsOrigins`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#allowcloudletsorigins) along with any other behaviors. It must be alone in its own rule. |

| `regex_validation_sureroute` |  The [`sureRoute`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#sureroute) behavior's `customMap` must be a subdomain of `akasrg.akamai.com`. |
| `requireakamaizer` |  The [`savePostDcaProcessing`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#savepostdcaprocessing) behavior doesn't work properly unless [`akamaizer`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#akamaizer) is enabled. |
| `required_mdc_for_saas_cname` |  For a behavior to specify a CNAME chain, the [`instantConfig`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#instantconfig) behavior must also be enabled, or the property must be [secure](#thedefaultrule). |
| `required_negative_caching` |  When your [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) is set to `NET_STORAGE`, set the [`cacheError`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cacheerror) with a `ttl` of at least 30 seconds. |
| `required_third_party_set` |  The [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) hostname is AWS, the `verificationMode` is set to `CUSTOM`, and `originCertsToHonor` is set to `STANDARD_CERTIFICATE_AUTHORITIES` or `COMBO`, but `standardCertificateAuthorities` doesn't include `THIRD_PARTY_AMAZON`. |
| `requires_caching_enabled` |  To set the cache's ID, the [`caching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#caching) behavior must be enabled. |
| `requires_extension_match` |  The [`imageManager`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#imagemanager) behavior requires a [`fileExtension`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#fileextension) match. |
| `requires_hoit_match` |  The [`http2`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#http2) and [`spdy`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#spdy) behaviors can only be enabled within a [`hostname`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#hostname) match. |
| `requires_mfro` |  The [`randomSeek`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#randomseek) behavior works best when [`mediaFileRetrievalOptimization`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#mediafileretrievaloptimization) is enabled. |
| `requires_nonsecure` |  To apply [`instantConfig`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#instantconfig) requires a non-[secure](#thedefaultrule) property. |
| `requires_origin_cacheley_inc_hh` |  You can't use [`cacheKeyRewrite`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachekeyrewrite) when the [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) behavior's `cacheKeyHostname` is set to `REQUEST_HOST_HEADER`.
| `requires_requestmethod_match` |  You can only enable the [`webdav`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#webdav) behavior when matching a [`requestMethod`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#requestmethod). |
| `requirescaching` |  When using [`cachePost`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachepost), you should also use [`caching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#caching) to define a caching strategy. |
| `requirespost` |  The [`savePostDcaProcessing`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#savepostdcaprocessing) behavior requires either [`allowPost`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#allowpost) or [`cachePost`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachepost) to be enabled. |
| `requirespostcaching` |  The [`savePostDcaProcessing`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#savepostdcaprocessing) behavior requires [`cachePost`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachepost) to be enabled. |
| `responsecode_conflict` |  The response code defined in [`constructResponse`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#constructresponse) and [`responseCode`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#responsecode) don't match. |
| `saas_origin_hostname_cn` |  When using a `SAAS_DYNAMIC_ORIGIN` [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin), you can't specify `{{Origin Hostname}}` in the `customValidCnValues`. |
| `salt_deprecated` |  The [`verifyTokenAuthorization`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#verifytokenauthorization) behavior's `salt` option will be removed in a future release, so you should remove it from your code. |
| `scheduledinvalidation` |  When the [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) is `NET_STORAGE`, the [`scheduleInvalidation`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#scheduleinvalidation) behavior's `repeatInterval` must be at least 5 minutes. |

| `sr_ss_map_mismatch` |  A [`sureRoute`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#sureroute) behavior specifies a `type` of `CUSTOM_MAP`, and the `customMap` doesn't match what's specified by [`siteShield`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#siteshield). |
| `sr_with_ss` |  With [`siteShield`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#siteshield) enabled, the optimization `type` for [`sureRoute`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#sureroute) should be `CUSTOM_MAP`. |
| `ss_incompatible` |  The [`instant`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#instant) behavior is incompatible with [`siteShield`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#siteshield). |
| `ssl_custom_warning_aux_list` |  In an early version of the [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) behavior, `origin_cert_delete` is set to `custom`. |
| `ssl_custom_warning_expert` |  Due to the security risk, Akamai _strongly_ recommends you consult with your organization's security expert before configuring the [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) SSL certificate verification settings. If you're the security expert and have any questions, contact your account team. |
| `ssl_custom_warning_test_staging` |  If you're changing your [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) SSL certificate verification settings, to avoid a service outage Akamai _strongly_ recommends testing on the staging network before activating on production. |
| `ssl_delegate_warning_intro` |  The [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) behavior has been enhanced to address the [FOSSL exploit](https://community.akamai.com/thread/2506). |
| `ssl_delegate_warning_rotate` |  The [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) behavior has been enhanced to address the [FOSSL exploit](https://community.akamai.com/thread/2506). |
| `ssl_warn_warning` |  An older [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) version specifies a `verificationMode` of `INSECURE`. |
| `subrules_need_condition` |  For [`allowCloudletsOrigins`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#allowcloudletsorigins) to work, you need to nest at least one rule with a single [`cloudletsOrigin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cloudletsorigin) criteria. |
| `suggest_edgeredirector` |  Instead of [`redirect`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#redirect), consider using the [`edgeRedirector`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#edgeredirector) Cloudlet, which allows non-IT staff to manage large numbers of redirects. |
| `sureroute_required` |  When applying [`instant`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#instant) to content whose [`caching`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#caching) is `NO_STORE`, the content must also have [`sureRoute`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#sureroute) enabled or it isn't prefetched. |
| `tcip_allow_clients_to_set_on` |  The [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin) is configured to allow clients to set the `True-Client-IP` header, meaning the IP value sent to the origin may not be the one the client used to connect to the edge server. While this may be useful for testing, it may allow users to bypass IP-based restrictions on your origin server. |
| `tcpoptisdeprecated` |  The [`tcpOptimization`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#tcpoptimization) behavior is deprecated, and you should remove it. |
| `td_with_modify_inplace` |   The [`tieredDistribution`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#tiereddistribution) behavior can't be `enabled` when the [`largeFileOptimization`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#largefileoptimization) behavior's `useVersioning` is disabled. |
| `td_with_ss` |  The [`siteShield`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#siteshield) behavior is incompatible with [`tieredDistribution`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#tiereddistribution) because both determine which Akamai servers connect directly to the origin. |
| `third_party_verificationmode` |  Setting the [`origin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#origin)'s `verificationMode` to `THIRD_PARTY` is incompatible with the specified `originType`. |
| `tiereddistribution_required` |  When applying [`instant`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#instant) to cacheable content, it must also have [`tieredDistribution`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#tiereddistribution) enabled or it isn't prefetched. |
| `unpurgeable` |  Enabling a behavior within a specified criteria prevents Content Control Utility from purging by URL. Contact your Akamai representative for guidance. |
| `urlrewrite_incompatible` |  When using [`removeQueryParameter`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#removequeryparameter), the [`rewriteUrl`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#rewriteurl) behavior's `keepQueryString` must also be enabled. |
| `usebody` |  The [`cachePost`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachepost) behavior specifies a `useBody` of `MD5` or `QUERY`, but there's no accompanying [`cacheId`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cacheid). |
| `warn_not_connnectingip` |  When setting [`denyAccess`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#denyaccess), disable the match's `useOnlyFirstXForwardedForIp` to prevent malicious end users from using `X-Forwarded-For` headers to bypass the policy. |
| `warn_regex` |  Test any regular expressions you specify in [`rewriteUrl`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#rewriteurl) on the staging network and contact your Akamai representative if you're uncertain how to use this option. |
| `wildcard_match_advised` |  You should enable [`limitBitRate`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#limitbitrate) with a [`filename`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#filename), [`fileExtension`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#fileextension), or [`path`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#path) match. |
| `with_ignore_case` |  To apply [`cacheKeyIgnoreCase`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cachekeyignorecase), you need to lowercase the `elements` specified by an accompanying [`cacheId`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cacheid), otherwise they never match. |
| `within_cloudlets_origins_group` |  This Cloudlet behavior may not work as expected when added to the same rule that sets the [`cloudletsOrigin`](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#cloudletsorigin). Consider moving it to a different rule. |
