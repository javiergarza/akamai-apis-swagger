The following represents all rule criteria the Property Manager API
supports.  The set available to you is determined by the product and
modules associated with the property, and you can get it by running
the [List available
criteria](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#listavailablecriteria)
operation.

This reference specifies the most recent set of features, that of the
`latest` rule format.  For information on features specified by older
rule formats, see the following:
