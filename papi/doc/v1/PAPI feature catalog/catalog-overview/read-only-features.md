Some of the behaviors and criteria listed in this reference are
identified as _read-only_. These advanced features often directly
specify raw XML metadata that, if not configured properly, may cause
unexpected problems when executing on edge servers.  Do not edit these
behaviors when modifying rules trees, and do not alter their sequence
within each rule.  Contact your Akamai representative for assistance
if you need to modify one of these behaviors. See the following in the
main PAPI guide for more information:

- [Advanced and locked features](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#advancedfeatures),
for more details on read-only features.

- [Custom behaviors and overrides](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/v1.html#custombehaviors),
for a way to apply advanced behaviors to many properties.
