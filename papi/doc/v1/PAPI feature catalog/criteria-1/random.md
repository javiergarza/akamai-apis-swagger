__Property Manager name__: [Sample Percentage](https://control.akamai.com/wh/CUSTOMER/AKAMAI/en-US/WEBHELP/property-manager/property-manager-help/csh_lookup.html?id=PM_0066)

Matches a specified percentage of requests. Use this match to apply behaviors to a percentage of your incoming requests that differ from the remainder, useful for A/b testing, or to offload traffic onto different servers.

__Options__:

- `bucket` (_number within 0-100 range_): Specify a percentage of random requests to which to apply a behavior. Any remainders do not match.
