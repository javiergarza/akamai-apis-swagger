__Property Manager name__: [HTTP to HTTPS Upgrade](https://control.akamai.com/wh/CUSTOMER/AKAMAI/en-US/WEBHELP/property-manager/property-manager-help/csh_lookup.html?id=PM_5005)

Upgrades an HTTP edge request to HTTPS for the remainder of the request flow. Enable this behavior only if your origin supports HTTPS, and if your [`origin`](#origin) behavior is configured with `originCertsToHonor` to verify SSL certificates.

This behavior does not include any options. Specifying the behavior itself enables it.
