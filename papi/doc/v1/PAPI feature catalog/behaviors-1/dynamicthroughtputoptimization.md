__Property Manager name__: [Quick Retry](https://control.akamai.com/wh/CUSTOMER/AKAMAI/en-US/WEBHELP/property-manager/property-manager-help/csh_lookup.html?id=PM_5015)

Enables _quick retry_, which detects slow forward throughput while fetching an object, and attempts a different forward connection path to avoid congestion. By default, connections under 5 mbps trigger this behavior.  Contact Akamai Professional Services to override this threshold.

__Options__:
