__Property Manager name__: [Download Complete Marker](https://control.akamai.com/wh/CUSTOMER/AKAMAI/en-US/WEBHELP/property-manager/property-manager-help/csh_lookup.html?id=PM_0036)

The [Internet of Things: OTA Updates](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/webhelp/iot/internet-of-things-over-the-air-user-guide/) product allows customers to securely distribute firmware to devices over cellular networks.  Based on match criteria that executes a rule, this behavior logs requests to the OTA servers as completed in aggregated and individual reports.

See also the [`downloadNotification`](#downloadnotification) and [`requestTypeMarker`](#requesttypemarker) behaviors.

This behavior does not include any options. Specifying the behavior itself enables it.
