__Property Manager name__: [SPDY](https://control.akamai.com/wh/CUSTOMER/AKAMAI/en-US/WEBHELP/property-manager/property-manager-help/csh_lookup.html?id=PM_9045)

Applies the SPDY protocol, which enhances HTTPS traffic by using many concurrent connections to download objects within one TCP connection. You can only apply this behavior within a [`hostname`](#hostname) match, and if the property is marked as secure.  See [Secure property requirements](#sf) for guidance.

This behavior does not include any options. Specifying the behavior itself enables it.
