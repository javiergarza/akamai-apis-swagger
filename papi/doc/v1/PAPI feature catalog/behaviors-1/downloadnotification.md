__Property Manager name__: [Download Notification](https://control.akamai.com/wh/CUSTOMER/AKAMAI/en-US/WEBHELP/property-manager/property-manager-help/csh_lookup.html?id=PM_0037)

The [Internet of Things: OTA Updates](https://learn.akamai.com/en-us/webhelp/iot/internet-of-things-over-the-air-user-guide/) product allows customers to securely distribute firmware to devices over cellular networks. Based on match criteria that executes a rule, this behavior allows requests to the [OTA Updates API](https://developer.akamai.com/api/web_performance/iot_ota_updates/v1.html) for a list of completed downloads to individual vehicles.

See also the [`downloadCompleteMarker`](#downloadcompletemarker) behavior.

This behavior does not include any options. Specifying the behavior itself enables it.
