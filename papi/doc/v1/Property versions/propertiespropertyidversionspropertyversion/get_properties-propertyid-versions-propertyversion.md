excerpt: "This polls the state of a specific property version, for example to check its activation status. When specifying `Accept: text/xml`, this operation provides the Akamai _metadata_ configuration data that's distributed to edge servers when the property version is activated. This XML data encapsulates the property version's component rules and hostnames, and is available on a read-only basis. Contact your Akamai representative if you need help interpreting it."
