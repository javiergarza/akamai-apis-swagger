excerpt: "Lists the set of [criteria](http://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/property_manager/vlatest.html#criteria) you may apply within a property version's rules. The available set is determined by the product under which you created the property, and any additional modules enabled under your account.\n\nNote that this list of available criteria is more accurate than that specified in the [rule format schema](https://papi-akamai.readme.io/reference/schemasproductsproductidruleformat#get_schemas-products-productid-ruleformat), which includes criteria you may potentially add to your contract for a given product, but that aren't currently active. However, it only lists criteria _currently_ available on your contract, so you should only use it to list available criteria for the current property version. If you had a behavior enabled at one time, but then dropped it from your contract, a list of available criteria for an older property version might be inaccurate."
