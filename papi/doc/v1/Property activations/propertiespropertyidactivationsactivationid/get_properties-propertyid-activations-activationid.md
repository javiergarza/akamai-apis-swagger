title: "Get an activation"
slug: "get_properties-propertyid-activations-activationid"
excerpt: "Gets details about an activation. You typically get a single activation from an `activationLink` when [launching a new activation](https://papi-akamai.readme.io/reference/propertiespropertyidactivations#post_properties-propertyid-activations) and following up to poll its `status`. For activations whose `status` is `PENDING`, a `Retry-After` header provides an estimate for when it's likely to change."
