title: "Create a new activation or deactivation"
slug: "post_properties-propertyid-activations"
excerpt: "This operation creates a new property activation, which\ndeactivates any current activation. After a necessary delay,\nthis activates your property version's rule tree and set of\nhostnames across Akamai's network of edge servers, modifying how\nyour edge content responds to end-user requests.\nIf there's a problem with the property you activated, you may\nhave the option to fall back to the previous version. Within an\nhour of activating, POSTing another activation with\n`\\\"useFastFallback\\\":true` in the request object disables the\ncurrent activation and falls back to the previous version. This\nfallback takes a few seconds, but the option is available only\nif there have been no changes to the set of property hostnames,\nas indicated by the\n[`canFastFallback`](#8b3213c5)\nmember.\n\nIf the activation request produces warnings, a 400 response\nindicates this problem message: `{\"type\":\n\"/papi/v0/activation-warnings-not-acknowledged\"}`. Subsequent\nrequests succeed if you list the `messageId` values in the\nrequest's `acknowledgeWarnings` array. Once an activation is\nsuccessful, it responds with a 201 code and provides a\n`Location` header and `activationLink` in the response\nobject indicating where to poll the status of the\nactivation.\n\n> __Note__. If you set `activationType` to `DEACTIVATE` in\nthe POST request object, the property would deactivate and\nno longer serve any traffic. You'd need to modify your DNS\nconfiguration and specify a different way to handle the\ntraffic. See [Enable traffic for a new edge\nhostname](doc:enable-traffic-for-a-new-edge-hostname) for more information."
