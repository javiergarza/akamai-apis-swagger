As a component of the\nlarger [Bulk patch a set of properties](https://papi-akamai.readme.io/reference/bulkrules-patch-requests#post_bulk-rules-patch-requests), this\noperation patches an individual rule tree. See [Bulk Search\nand Update](doc:learn-about-bulk) for more information.\nTo bypass a set of validation tests that may significantly\nslow this operation's execution time, set the `validateRules`\nquery parameter to `false` or `validateMode` to `fast`. See\n[Fast validation, activation, and fallback](doc:fast-validation) for more\ninformation."
