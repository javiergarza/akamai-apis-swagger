slug: "get_bulk-activations-bulkactivationid"
excerpt: "List all activations that result from a [bulk activation request](https://papi-akamai.readme.io/reference/bulkactivations#post_bulk-activations), and poll the asynchronous process's status. Once the overall `bulkActivationStatus` is `COMPLETE`, check each activation's `activationStatus` to confirm it's `ACTIVATED`. The response is a [BulkActivation](#bulkactivation) GET object. See [Bulk Search and Update](doc:learn-about-bulk) for overall guidance on this feature."
