title: "List groups"
slug: "get_groups"
excerpt: "You need information about the prevailing group to access most PAPI interfaces. This operation provides a read-only list of groups, which may contain properties. This operation provides a flat list of groups, along with `parentGroupId` information to structure them as a hierarchy. Each group also lists any available contracts that enable property features, but not which group contains a given property. The [Identity Management: User Administration API](http://learn.akamai.com/en-us/api/core_features/identity_management_user_admin/v2.html) allows you to associate properties with groups, and to modify the group hierarchy.
