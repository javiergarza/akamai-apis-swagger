          XXX Bulk activate a set of property versions.
          (Alternately, perform a bulk [fallback](doc:fast-validation) to the previous
          activation within an hour of the previous bulk activation.)
          Base the set of versions to activate on the results of a
          [bulk patch](https://dash.readme.com/project/papi-akamai/v1/refs/get_bulk-rules-patch-requests-bulkpatchid)
          operation, which you use to create a
          [BulkActivation](#bulkactivation) POST object.
          This operation launches an asynchronous process to update
          properties. To check its progress, run the
          [List bulk-activated properties](https://papi-akamai.readme.io/reference/bulkactivationsbulkactivationid#get_bulk-activations-bulkactivationid)
          operation, whose link is available in the `Location` header or
          `bulkActivationLink` member of this operation's response. See
          [Bulk Search and Update](doc:learn-about-bulk)
          for overall guidance on this feature.
